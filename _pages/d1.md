As a 22-year-old university student, I embarked on a transformative journey when I took art history and interactive media courses in my freshman year. Before I even knew the term "digital humanities," I became interested in the intersection and application of digital spaces into musuem institutions. My personal interests slowly developed into my academic focus and have culminated into me taking the course "Intro to Digital Humanities" and hopefully implementing it in my capstone.

Before immersing ourselves in the world of digital humanities, we had already developed our own strategies for navigating the digital landscape in both daily life and academics. As a Gen Z, I have a familiar and comforting relationship with technology and digital spaces. I grew up with the constant change and development of physical technology as well as the so called "internet culture" and many digital tools.  

My academic journey has been marked by more analog processess, and there is definitely a trend or stereotype within the humanities of being clumsy with technology and have more archaic but nostalgic practices. In classes, while many of my professors utilize online resources, some still prefer printed books or request scans from libraries. With art history specifically, there is also another challenge with images and copyright or publication; there are books or catalogs that include full images of the artworks in printed copies but their online counterpart may not, due to different applications of copyright. Even at internships, I was surprised by how analog some of these processes are and how difficult it can be to adapt to the digital age.

I have also advanced my knowledge of digital tools in specific interactive courses and personal projects. From learning to code simple programs or utilizing software like Adobe Creative Suite, I have learned many new skills throught the years. A more unexpected "soft" skills was understanding the mechanisms of many digital tools and how to adap them, like knowing how to use keywords in the best way etc, the importance of access to research databases to archive my literary and artistic sources.

The digital humanities course has illuminated my knowledge of digital tools, and has broadened and defined the scope of these tools. I find the discussions on AI-generated content really interesting especially as we discuss some of the more innovative applications of this technology, rather than almost plagiaristic and exploitative but common uses are. I have also just enjoyed learning about new digital tools, the history of many digital terms or ideas and it has also inspired me to apply some new ideas for my capstone. since the class also has diverse academic backgrounds and we found ourselves engaging in thought-provoking conversations that spanned our areas of expertise, enriching our perspectives and generating innovative ideas. Collaborating across disciplines proved to be a catalyst for creativity and interdisciplinary thinking.

Research data management and manipulation emerged as a common thread that united us all. We delved into text analysis, data visualization, and digital archives. Tools like Zotero and Omeka became invaluable for organizing, annotating, and sharing research materials. The importance of data literacy transcended individual majors, equipping us to navigate the data-driven landscape of the digital age.

Our critical reflection on our current abilities led us to appreciate the concept of “computational thinking” in the age of AI. We understood that skills in data analysis, algorithm understanding, and result interpretation were universally valuable, regardless of our major. As AI continues to shape our world, these skills will empower us to harness its potential for innovation and informed decision-making.

Digital humanities has broadened our horizons, offering fresh perspectives on our respective fields of study. We began to contemplate the ethical implications of AI and data usage within our disciplines. Computer Science majors questioned the ethical responsibilities of AI developers, while Literature and Creative Writing students considered the impact of AI-generated content on storytelling. Environmental Studies majors explored AI’s potential in climate change monitoring, and Business and Marketing students delved into AI-driven market analysis.

Looking ahead, we are excited to continue our exploration of new ways of thinking and working. We aim to cultivate a holistic approach to education that recognizes the value of interdisciplinary thinking in a digitally driven world. We envision a future where collaboration between artists, scientists, scholars, and creators becomes the norm, fostering innovation and pushing the boundaries of our fields.

In conclusion, our journey through digital humanities has been transformative. It has expanded our horizons, bridged the gap between technology and the humanities, and equipped us with a multifaceted understanding of digital literacy. As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, we are poised to embrace new ways of thinking and working that promote interdisciplinary collaboration and responsible digital citizenship. In the age of AI, we are ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
